# Multiresolution-GFT
This repository contains Matlab files that implement the multi-resolution graph Fourier transform coding as described in the following paper:

Wei Hu, Gene Cheung, Antonio Ortega, and Oscar C. Au, “Multi-resolution Graph Fourier Transform for Compression of Piecewise Smooth Images,” IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP), vol. 24, no. 1, pp. 419-433, Jan. 2015.

You are free to use / modify / distribute the code for non-profit academic research purposes. We only ask that you cite the above paper in your publications. 

# Run the code
1. Training 
"collectTableGBT": train the lookup table for Graph Transforms (GTs)

2. Testing
"main_test": two transform modes (8x8 DCT, 4x4 LR-GFT)
